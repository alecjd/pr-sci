+ Backend Golang Workflow
++ NodeJS runs the files, so no need to create anything with Golang
++ Commit standalone Go code first
++ Pull repo into GOPATH, create nodejs_dev branch for each parser, checkout dev branch, make mods for gonode, then build the go code and import into node
++ Move Go code over to the nodejs app
++ Use gulp as the build tool
